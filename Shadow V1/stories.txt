1. The Fox and the Grapes
Once upon a time, a fox saw a bunch of grapes hanging. He tried and tried but couldn’t reach. Tired and frustrated, he walked away saying, “They’re probably sour anyway.”

2. The Tortoise and the Hare
The hare boasted about how fast he could run. Tired of hearing him boast, the tortoise challenged him to a race. The hare raced ahead and, confident of winning, took a nap midway. When he awoke, he found that the tortoise, crawling slowly but steadily, had arrived before him.

3. The Lion and the Mouse
A lion caught a mouse. The mouse pleaded for his life and promised to help the lion someday. Amused, the lion let him go. Later, the lion got trapped in a hunter’s net. The mouse came, gnawed through the ropes, and saved the lion.
